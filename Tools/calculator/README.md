# Calculator

## Restrictions

- Equations are strictly evaluated left to right (so don't be surprised when it can't accurately compute more complex equations)
- Equations must be entered WITHOUT spaces. For example:
    - `Correct`: 
        >\>\>\> 4+3/99+4 
    - `Incorrect`:
        >\>\>\> 5 + 4 + 99 - 33 * 4
- Parenthesis are not yet included (this requires _a lot_ of more work to validate. I encourage anyone to try though. You'll have to use a more advanced algorithm).
